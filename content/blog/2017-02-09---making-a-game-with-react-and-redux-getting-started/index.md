In this series, I am creating a typing game with React and Redux. Including setting up a backlog, CI, and Testing.
You can find the project [here](https://github.com/nadeemkhedr/typemania)

I'm relatively new to React/Redux when it comes to real world experience but I've read a whole ton about them, and I am comfortable enough to build an app with the stack

I'm a huge fan of the redux architecture, I've written about [elm](https://medium.com/@nadeemkhedr/i-love-elm-and-hate-static-typing-languages-86462def3f0f#.32arndqx6) and how I've loved it _(Redux uses the same archetecture)_, now I want to get real with building an app.

In this series I want to show as much as possible of the process of creating a real world project, starting with creating backlog to setting up a CI and testing to building the app.
In every blog I'll talk about what I should have done, what problems I had, and how did I get around solving them.

I will make this whole thing open source, added a project to GitHub and all the backlog will be there
