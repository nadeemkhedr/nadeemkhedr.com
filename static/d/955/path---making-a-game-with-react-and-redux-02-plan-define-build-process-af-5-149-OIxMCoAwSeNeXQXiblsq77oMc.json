I will go with git flow. To read more about the topic of merge strategies check this <a href=\"http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/choose-right-git-branching-strategy-121518344\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Another great topic that is not often looked into is commit message format; we will be using the <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">angular guideline</a>, which I highly recommend.</p>\n<p>A great github tool that helps us to standardize PRs &#x26; Issues format is to use templates. Creating <code class=\"language-text\">ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md</code> will pre-fill the text when creating an issue or a PR.\nIt is useful to put guidelines on steps/sections when creating issues/PRs so that every user will respect them.</p>\n<p>I think, when starting a project, these are some of the most important things to prepare at first to ensure the consistency of the project.</p>\n<h2>Define</h2>\n<p>The biggest issue when working on a new project is not setting up the definition of done.\nSetting a release plan and also boundaries for each task instead of just working on the game is important for many reasons.\n<strong>Just</strong> working on a game will drag on forever, because whenever you should be working on one feature, you will find yourself constantly creating/working on new, unrelated features</p>\n<p>To avoid this, I am going to use <a href=\"https://www.zenhub.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">zenhub</a> for creating and managing stories. ZenHub extends GitHub, and all stories you create are GitHub issues with the added bonus of having another tab in GitHub (Board) from it, so you can easily manage sprints.</p>\n<p>The benefit of using all these tools is that, now, everything is on Github, it is the single source of truth.</p>\n<p>The other part of defining is trying to be as detailed as possible. One thing I see a lot is vague stories. Let me tell you an example:</p>\n<h4>Vague Story Example</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As an admin I want to be able to delete other users</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> You might find this definition is okay, but If I got assigned to this story, I would have the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can an admin delete other admins?</li>\n<li>When deleting, should I show a confirmation dialog, undo button, or some other verification method?</li>\n<li>When deleting a user, should I remove the record from the DB, or should I add an <code class=\"language-text\">inactive</code> field?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Build Process</h2>\n<p>There are two things I want to do here</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add precommit to run linting &#x26; testing</li>\n<li>add Travis for running the tests before accepting the</li>\n</ul>\n<p>we can use <a href=\"https://github.com/typicode/husky\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">husky</a> for preventing bad commits; it adds hooks to run <code class=\"language-text\">precommit</code> &#x26; <code class=\"language-text\">prepush</code> scripts, so what we could do is, in <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">scripts: {\n    &quot;precommit&quot;: &quot;npm run lint &amp;&amp; npm test&quot;\n    ...\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>Adding Travis is simple, we will create <code class=\"language-text\">.travis.yml</code> with the following</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">language: node_js\nnode_js:\n  - 6\ncache:\n  directories:\n  - node_modules\nscript:\n  - npm test</code></pre></div>\n<p>After that, going to <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">travis</a> and adding the github project will do the trick.\nNow Travis will run <code class=\"language-text\">npm test</code> after pushing code while working on a feature</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Making a game with React and Redux: 02 Plan, Define, Build Process","date":"February 16, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"making-a-game-with-react-and-redux-02-plan-define-build-process/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"making-a-game-with-react-and-redux-getting-started/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Making a game with React and Redux: 01 Getting Started"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"making-a-game-with-react-and-redux-03-core-mechanics/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Making a game with React and Redux: 03 Core Mechanics"}}}}
